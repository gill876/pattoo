After installation, you will need to create a configuration file in a directory dedicated to ``pattoo``.

*********************************************
Setting the  Configuration Directory Location
*********************************************

Currently the configuration directory is automatically set when the installationscript is run

Configuration Options

There are two ways to configure ``pattoo``. These are the:

#. Quick Method
#. Expert Method

Quick Method
============

Use the quick method if you are new to ``pattoo``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo setup/pattoo_installation.py install configuration


The above command will set the most optimal defaults for your system for pattoo.

Additionally, the pattoo user and group will be created with the home directory for the pattoo user being /home/pattoo
All related directories and their subdirectories will be owned by the pattoo user

To guarantee success you will need to know the following beforehand.

#. ``db_name``: Database name
#. ``db_username``: Database username
#. ``db_password``: Database password
#. ``db_hostname``: Database hostname



Expert Method
=============

This section goes into configuration parameters in great detail.

Copy the Templates to Your Configuration Directory
--------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps in this section if you don't already have a valid configuration files in your ``PATTOO_CONFIGDIR`` directory.

Copy the template files in the ``examples/etc`` directory to the ``PATTOO_CONFIGDIR`` location.

**NOTE:** If a ``/path/to/configuration/directory/pattoo_server.yaml`` or ``/path/to/configuration/directory/pattoo.yaml`` file already exists in the directory then skip this step and edit the file according to the steps in following sections.

.. code-block:: bash

        $ cp examples/etc/pattoo_server.yaml.template \
            /path/to/configuration/directory/pattoo_server.yaml

        $ cp examples/etc/pattoo.yaml.template \
            /path/to/configuration/directory/pattoo.yaml

The next step is to edit the contents of both files.

Edit Your Configuration Files
-----------------------------

The ``pattoo`` server uses two configuration files:

#. ``pattoo.yaml``: Provides general configuration information for all ``pattoo`` related applications. ``pattoo.yaml`` also defines how ``pattoo`` agents should connect to the ``pattoo`` server APIs.
#. ``pattoo_server.yaml``: Provides configuration details for all the ``pattoo`` server's API daemons. These APIs accept data from ``pattoo`` agents and also provide data to ``pattoo`` related applications through your browser.

Take some time to read up on ``YAML`` formatted files if you are not familiar with them. A background knowledge is always helpful.

Server Configuration File
.........................

The ``pattoo_server.yaml`` file created from the template will have sections that you will need to edit with custom values. Don't worry, these sections are easily identifiable as they all start with ``PATTOO_``

**NOTE:** The indentations in the YAML configuration are important. Make sure indentations line up. Dashes '-' indicate one item in a list of items (if applicable).

.. code-block:: yaml

   pattoo_api_agentd:

       ip_bind_port: 20201
       ip_listen_address: 0.0.0.0

   pattoo_apid:

       ip_bind_port: 20202
       ip_listen_address: 0.0.0.0

   pattoo_ingesterd:

       ingester_interval: 3600
       batch_size: 500
       graceful_timeout: 10

   pattoo_db:
       db_pool_size: 10
       db_max_overflow: 10
       db_hostname: PATTOO_DB_HOSTNAME
       db_name: PATTOO_DB_NAME
       db_password: PATTOO_DB_PASSWORD
       db_username: PATTOO_DB_USERNAME

Server Configuration Explanation

This table outlines the purpose of each configuration parameter.

   * - Section
     - Configuration Parameters
     - Description
   * - ``pattoo_api_agentd``
     -
     -
   * -
     - ``ip_listen_address``
     - IP address used by the ``pattoo_api_agentd`` daemon for accepting data from remote ``pattoo`` agents. Default of '0.0.0.0' which indicates listening on all available network interfaces. You can also use IPv6 nomenclature such as ``::``. The ``pattoo`` APIs don't support IPv6 and IPv4 at the same time.
   * -
     - ``ip_bind_port``
     - TCP port of used by the ``pattoo_api_agentd`` daemon for accepting data from remote ``pattoo`` agents. Default of 20201.
   * - ``pattoo_apid``
     -
     -
   * -
     - ``ip_listen_address``
     - IP address used by the ``pattoo_apid`` daemon for providing data to remote clients. Default of '0.0.0.0' which indicates listening on all available network interfaces. You can also use IPv6 nomenclature such as ``::``. The ``pattoo`` APIs don't support IPv6 and IPv4 at the same time.
   * -
     - ``ip_bind_port``
     - TCP port of used by the ``pattoo_apid`` daemon for providing data to remote clients. Default of 20202.
   * - ``pattoo_ingesterd``
     -
     -
   * -
     - ``ingester_interval``
     - The interval between checking for new agent files in the cache directory. Only valid if using the ``pattoo_ingesterd`` daemon.
   * -
     - ``batch_size``
     - The number of files to read per processing batch until all files are processed.
   * -
     - ``graceful_timeout``
     - The amount of time required for the ingester to finish processing data when the stop or restart command is excuted before it is forcefully stopped or restarted.
   * - ``pattoo_db``
     -
     -
   * -
     - ``db_hostname``
     - Hostname of the database server

     - Password required for database access
   * -
     - ``db_name``
     - Name of database
   * -
     - ``db_pool_size``
     - This is the largest number of connections that will be keep persistently with the database
   * -
     - ``db_max_overflow``
     - Maximum overflow size. When the number of connections reaches the size set in ``db_pool_size``, additional connections will be returned up to this limit. This is the floating number of additional database connections to be made available.


Client Configuration File
.........................

The ``pattoo.yaml`` file created from the template will have sections that you will need to edit with custom values. Don't worry, these sections are easily identifiable as they all start with ``PATTOO_``

**NOTE:** The indentations in the YAML configuration are important. Make sure indentations line up. Dashes '-' indicate one item in a list of items (if applicable).

.. code-block:: yaml

   pattoo:
       log_level: debug
       log_directory: PATTOO_LOG_DIRECTORY
       cache_directory: PATTOO_CACHE_DIRECTORY
       daemon_directory: PATTOO_DAEMON_DIRECTORY
       system_daemon_directory: PATTOO_SYSTEM_DAEMON_DIRECTORY


Client Configuration Explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table outlines the purpose of each configuration parameter.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Section
     - Configuration Parameters
     - Description
   * - ``pattoo``
     -
     -
   * -
     - ``log_directory``
     - Path to logging directory. Make sure the username running the daemons have RW access to files there.
   * -
     - ``log_level``
     - Default level of logging. ``debug`` is best for troubleshooting.
   * -
     - ``cache_directory``
     - Directory that will temporarily store data data from agents prior to be added to the ``pattoo`` database.
   * -
     - ``daemon_directory``
     - Directory used to store daemon related data that needs to be maintained between reboots
   * -
     - ``system_daemon_directory``
     - Directory used to store daemon related data that should be deleted between reboots. This should only be configured if you are running ``pattoo`` daemons as ``systemd`` daemons. The ``systemd`` daemon installation procedure automatically adjusts this configuration. This parameter defaults to the ``daemon_directory`` value if it is not configured.
